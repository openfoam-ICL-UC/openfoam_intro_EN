# Day-2

This folder contains the case directories for sessions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.


## Session 2.3 - tutorial

Three folders a are provided, with a separate README.MD file with instructions

- waterOilEvaporationBase: here is where you should start, as it just constitutes a copy of the tutorial `multiComponentEvaporation` of the `icoReactingMultiphaseInterFoam` solver 
- waterOilEvaporation: contains the solution of the problem under the assumption of a fixed bottom superheating $\Delta T_{sh} = 12 K$.
- waterOilEvaporationHeatFlux: contains the solution of the problem under the assumption of a fixed bottom heatflux $q_{bot}$.
